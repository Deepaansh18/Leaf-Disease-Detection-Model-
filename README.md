**Plant Disease Recognition System**

**1.Overview of the project**
This project uses photos of leaves to identify plant diseases using a deep learning-based system. The system recognizes different plant diseases and 
makes fast predictions using refined transfer learning models.Farmers and researchers can easily utilize the solution 
thanks to its straightforward web interface.

**2.Features**
•  Divides photos of plant leaves into several disease categories.
•  Explains the causes of diseases and offers recommendations for treatments.
•  Immediate predictions and an easy-to-use web interface for uploading images.

**3.Technologies/Tools Used**
• Python 3
• Tkinter (for GUI)
• Pillow (for image processing)
• AI/ML model integration 

**4.Steps to Install & Run the Project**
• Ensure Python 3 is installed.
• Install Pillow:pip install pillow
• Save the provided Python code to a .py file.​
• Run the file:python yourfilename.py
• The GUI will open; click "Upload Leaf Image (Input)" and select a leaf image.

**5.Instructions for testing**
•   Open the web interface.
•   Click "Choose File" to upload a sample leaf image.
•   Click "Upload" to get the prediction.
•   The interface will display the predicted disease, its cause, and recommended cure.
•   Test using various images from the Plant Village dataset .
