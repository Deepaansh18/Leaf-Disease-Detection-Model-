**Problem Statement**
Agricultural productivity is significantly impacted by plant diseases, which cause an estimated 10-16% annual crop loss worldwide. Current disease detection methods rely heavily on manual inspection by agricultural experts, which presents several critical challenges:
#Time-consuming: Experts cannot inspect all crops regularly, leading to delayed disease identification
#Expensive: Professional agricultural consultation is costly and inaccessible to small-scale farmers

**Scope of the Project**
#In Scope: Image processing, disease classification, GUI, disease types, error handling, offline capability
#Out of Scope: Mobile apps, cloud storage, real-time camera, batch processing, etc.

**Target Users**
#Primary: Small-scale farmers, agricultural officers, students
#Secondary: Consultants, gardeners
#User characteristics and technical levels

**High-Level Features**
#Image Upload & Validation
#Image Display & Preview
#Disease Detection & Classification
